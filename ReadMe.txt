I wrote this program as a tool I needed for my own use.
I asked a friend that has a ton of MP3's to provide me with a list of what he has.
The problem is that he had groups of MP3's in various dirs on multiple drives.
He didn't even know what he actually had himself.
I needed the list right away so I got him to make a list for each drive using DOS:
dir *.mp3 /s > c:\filelisting.txt
this works but was messy and not very good.
I decided to throw a program together to provide a solution.
This program is pretty basic.
It's only purpose in life is to easily search a computer for all MP3 files and
create a listing to be imported into a spreadsheet or copied to the clipboard to
paste into an email or into a word processor to create a multi column listing.
Yes, I realize there are probably a zillion such programs out there but this one
does exactly what I want it to do and nothing more.


Feel free to use parts of this code but please do not redistribute it of sell it as is.
